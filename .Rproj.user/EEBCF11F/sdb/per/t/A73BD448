Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. \n\nThe sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.\n\n## Attribute Information\nFor each record in the dataset it is provided: \n- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. \n- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. \n- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. \n- Its activity label. \n- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.\n- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].\n\n## Variable Description of tidy data\n\nTotal number of variables: 68\n\n 1. subject:\n experiment subjects\n type: integer\n range: [1,30]\n \n \n 2. activity:\n subject's activity type\n type: factor\n range: \n 1 WALKING\n 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS\n 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS\n 4 SITTING\n 5 STANDING\n 6 LAYING\n \n 3.~ 68.\n variable names:\n timeBodyAccelerometerMean-X\n timeBodyAccelerometerMean-Y   \n timeBodyAccelerometerMean-Z \n timeBodyAccelerometer-std-X    \n timeBodyAccelerometer-std-Y \n timeBodyAccelerometer-std-Z  \n timeGravityAccelerometerMean-X   \n timeGravityAccelerometerMean-Y     \n timeGravityAccelerometerMean-Z    \n timeGravityAccelerometer-std-X                 \n timeGravityAccelerometer-std-Y                 \n timeGravityAccelerometer-std-Z                 \n timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMean-X                \n timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMean-Y                \n timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMean-Z                \n timeBodyAccelerometerJerk-std-X                \n timeBodyAccelerometerJerk-std-Y                \n timeBodyAccelerometerJerk-std-Z                \n timeBodyGyroscopeMean-X                        \n timeBodyGyroscopeMean-Y                        \n timeBodyGyroscopeMean-Z                       \n timeBodyGyroscope-std-X                       \n timeBodyGyroscope-std-Y                       \n timeBodyGyroscope-std-Z                       \n timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMean-X                   \n timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMean-Y                   \n timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMean-Z                   \n timeBodyGyroscopeJerk-std-X                    \n timeBodyGyroscopeJerk-std-Y                    \n timeBodyGyroscopeJerk-std-Z                   \n timeBodyAccelerometerMagnitudeMean             \n timeBodyAccelerometerMagnitudeStdDev           \n timeGravityAccelerometerMagnitudeMean          \n timeGravityAccelerometerMagnitudeStdDev        \n timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitudeMean         \n timeBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitudeStdDev       \n timeBodyGyroscopeMagnitudeMean                 \n timeBodyGyroscopeMagnitudeStdDev               \n timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitudeMean             \n timeBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitudeStdDev           \n frequencyBodyAccelerometerMean-X               \n frequencyBodyAccelerometerMean-Y              \n frequencyBodyAccelerometerMean-Z               \n frequencyBodyAccelerometer-std-X               \n frequencyBodyAccelerometer-std-Y               \n frequencyBodyAccelerometer-std-Z               \n frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMean-X          \n frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMean-Y          \n frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMean-Z           \n frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerk-std-X           \n frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerk-std-Y           \n frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerk-std-Z          \n frequencyBodyGyroscopeMean-X                   \n frequencyBodyGyroscopeMean-Y                   \n frequencyBodyGyroscopeMean-Z                   \n frequencyBodyGyroscope-std-X                  \n frequencyBodyGyroscope-std-Y                   \n frequencyBodyGyroscope-std-Z                   \n frequencyBodyAccelerometerMagnitudeMean        \n frequencyBodyAccelerometerMagnitudeStdDev      \n frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitudeMean    \n frequencyBodyAccelerometerJerkMagnitudeStdDev  \n frequencyBodyGyroscopeMagnitudeMean            \n frequencyBodyGyroscopeMagnitudeStdDev          \n frequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitudeMean        \n frequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMagnitudeStdDev\n \n type: numeric\n range:[-1,1]",
